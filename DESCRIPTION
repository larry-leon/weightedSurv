Description:
  Survival analysis functions allowing for time-dependent and subject-specific
  (eg, propensity-scores) weighting. Weighted estimation for Cox model,
  Kaplan-Meier treatment survival curves as well as treatment difference along
  with point-wise and simultaneous confidence bands, and restricted mean
  survival time comparisons where RMST estimates are evaluated across all
  potential truncation times (point-wise and simultaneous bands).

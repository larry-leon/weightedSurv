Description: Survival analysis functions allowing for time-dependent and subject-specific (eg, propensity-scores) weighting. Weighted estimation for Cox model, Kaplan-Meier treatment survival curves as well as treatment difference along with point-wise and simultaneous confidence bands, and restricted mean survival time comparisons where RMST estimates are evaluated across all potential truncation times (point-wise and simultaneous bands).

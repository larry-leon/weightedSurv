Title: Survival Analysis with Subject-Specific (Case Weights) and Time-Dependent Weighting
Version: 0.1.0

Description:
  Survival analysis functions allowing for time-dependent and subject-specific
  (for example, propensity-scores) weighting. Weighted estimation for Cox model,
  Kaplan-Meier treatment survival curves as well as treatment difference along
  with point-wise and simultaneous confidence bands, and restricted mean
  survival time comparisons where 'RMST' estimates are evaluated across all
  potential truncation times (point-wise and simultaneous bands).
